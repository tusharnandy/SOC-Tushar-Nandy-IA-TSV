1. classified songs on the basis of genres, artists, popularity and moods
2. made UI separately
3. converted categorical data into dimensions
4. approach somewhat like knn
5. knn is used for 'categorization' and 'regression'
6. for this task, we need 'selection'
7. the basic code for each command enterred by a user is different
8. 'next', 'skip-next', and 'search'; all produce a different effect on the rating of moods:
9. these changes in the rating depend on how many times a song is skipped
10. no need for graphs i guess
11. a model for accuracy is developed, taking into account how many times our model faces rejections
12. additionally, add a few results from the main output
